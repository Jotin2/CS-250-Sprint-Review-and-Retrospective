# CS-250-Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
CS-250 class final project deliverable that pulls together the agile and Scrum practices that I have applied throughout the course.

1) How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To iimplment an end user's needs into a program, the Product Owner must interview end users in order to understand what they want from the product. To help with interpreting the interview, "user stories" are generated in order to help understand what they need. These user stories clearly detail an end goal that they want to see in the end product. These user stories, after being read and understood by the testers will then be translated into test cases, created by the testers. These test cases help implment them into the program, as it helps set conditions to deterimine whether the product satisfies the given requirements laid out by the test cases. Ultimately, user stories help interpret user needs, and test cases help implement them into a program.

2) How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

By using agile to develop programs, there are many steps along the way that will help you succeed. One way is to use the Scrum framework, which consists of product backlog, sprint backlog and increment. Having a product backlog, is to have a dynamic list of features that helps feed into your sprint backlog. Your sprint backlog is what is being developed for implementation for the current sprint cycle. Lastly, increment (sprint goal) is a usable end-product developed by the end of a sprint. Incorporating this can be helped more easily by having Scrum events such as Sprint planning, to help organize what will be done during the sprint cycle. The daily scrum, to help everyone to be on the same page and make sure everyone is aligned with the sprint goal. Lastly, the sprint review and retrospective to help review the product and also the team. 

3) What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development is knowing how to work as a team. Because agile is setup so the teams are very collaborative, knowing to to work with others is essential. Knowing how to communicate any problems, and even your successes is vital in this sort of environment as transparancy is key since there is a daily scrum every morning. Time management is also a good characteristic to have as other people rely on you to do your work on time in order for them to do their work more efficiently.
